Description:

I want to make a chrome application and haskell library that interfaces with another haskell library designed to program music called tidalcycles. 
The haskell library would be compiled to javascript, specifically the creative coding library p5.js, and sent to the chrome application to be rendered in real time. 
Basically, I want a system that can generate live visuals in accordance with the live music generated by tidalcycles.


Competitive Analysis:
There have been several attempts to interface tidalcycles and live visuals, but for most attempts, their structure involves programming audio in tidalcycles, and programming visuals in strictly the rendering language.
There has been a couple attempts to provide such interface by the creator of tidalcycles, but both haven't made it past very early stages and are very restricted in what visuals can be generated.
